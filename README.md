### Hello!
I'm Anna, a Computer Science and Data Science undergraduate sophomore student at Purdue University. I'm currently an intern working with @FSSA on how they can improve their healthcare services to those with intellectual and development disabilities by cleaning and analyzing their metadata provided by multiple different organizations within the Division of Disability and Rehabilitative Services. I am currently using SQL, Azure Data Studio, Tableau, Azure Databricks, and Python to decipher the effects different services have on those with these disabilities and to ultimately develop a coherent plan to improve such services.
