### Hello!
I'm Anna, a Computer Science and Data Science undergraduate sophomore student at Purdue University. I'm currently an intern working with @FSSA on crafting an effective data strategy in order to improve data governance among the many divisions in FSSA. A use-case I am working on is improving the treatment and services provided to those with intellectual and development disabilities by working with Division of Disability and Rehabilitative Services. I am currently using SQL, Azure Data Studio, Tableau, Azure Databricks, and R to decipher the effects different services have on those with these disabilities and to ultimately develop a coherent strategy to improve such services.
