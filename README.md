### Hello!
I'm Anna, a Computer Science and Data Science undergraduate sophomore student at Purdue University. I'm currently an intern working with @FSSA on how they can improve their healthcare services to those with intellectual and development disabilities by cleaning and analyzing their metadata provided by multiple different organizations.
I am currently using SQL, Azure Data Studio, Tableau, Azure Databricks, and Python scripting to aid in this process.
